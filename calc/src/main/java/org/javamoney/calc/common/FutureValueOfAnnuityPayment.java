/**
 * The annuity payment formula shown above is used to calculate the cash flows of an annuity when
 * future value is known. An annuity is denoted as a series of periodic payments. The annuity
 * payment formula shown here is specifically used when the future value is known, as opposed to the
 * annuity payment formula used when present value is known. There are not only mathematical
 * differences between calculating an annuity when present value is known and when future value is
 * known, but also differences in the real life application of the formulas. For example, if an
 * individual is wanting to calculate the payments on a loan, the original loan balance would be
 * considered the present value and the payment formula would accommodate this known variable.
 * However, if an individual is wanting to calculate how much they need to save per year in an
 * interest bearing account to have a certain balance after a specific period of time, then this
 * wanted balance would be considered the future value. The latter example would use the annuity
 * payment using future value formula as the balance is increasing instead of decreasing:
